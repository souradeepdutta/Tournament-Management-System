st.markdown(""" ***A new chess tournament management system that is designed to
address these challenges*** """)
st.markdown(""" Current chess tournament systems stifle growth with:
- Limited data analysis hindering informed decision-making
- Lack of accessibility and scalability for large-scale events
- Hard for competitors to query large amounts of data
- Hard to maintain up-to-date information about player eligibility
- Chess software is out-of-date
- Lack of a centralized system to handle ELO updates making the system more error-prone
